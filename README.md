This is a project for "Advanced Topics in 3D Computer Vision" Praktikum course, offered by TUM in Winter Semeser 2019. In this project, we have implemented a pipline to do a 3D recunstrion of a scene, using a depth camera, segment the objects and then use the data to do augmentations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* One of the libraries we use is [Open3D](http://open3d.org), which does not support Python 3.7. We recommend running the code using a Python Enviroment.
* For Mac users, the SDK of the [IntelÂ® RealSense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/python) (the RGBD camera which we use is not available, so you have to build the files from source and add it to the 'pyrealsenseformac' folder.



### Running

To run the whole pipline with UI, jut go the root directory and run.
```
python main.py
```
